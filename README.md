Printer build details:
Derived from many other printers, this started out as a ‘build a printer with my son with all the spare parts I’d acquired over the years. 

It ended up being a: “Here’s you you build a stout, easy-to-calibrate, printer, maximizing metal parts for rigidity, and minimizing the unique printed parts, which you’d print several of, once your available printer was tuned as best as it could be. 

For example: You get your settings correct for your printer to print the Bearing holders, then print 8 identical parts as they’re used in all corners. 

Second Example: In order for me to mount the linear bearings and 20x20 extrusions in my Z-Build Plate frame, I needed to scale it up to 106%…likewise, I also needed to scale the Z-Rod supports to 106% so that they’d mate up with the Z-Bed frame. 

Printer is designed to use 10mm Rods in XY movement, with 10mm ID bushings, on 8mm rods for the gantry.
